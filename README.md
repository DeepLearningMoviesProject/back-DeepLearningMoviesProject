## Unit tests

You can run all unit tests by using 'python -m unittest discover' command anywhere on the path back-DeepLearningMoviesProject/MovieProject/tests/unit, the command will run scripts looking like 'test_something.py'.
To run only one test file, you just have to execute the script the classic way : 'python test_something.py'.
